            Access tokens are credentials used to access protected resources.<br/>
            Access tokens are used as bearer tokens. A bearer token means that the bearer (who holds the access token) can access authorized resources without further identification.<br/>
            Storing the refresh token in an in-memory JavaScript variable.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            Refresh token is a long-lived token compared to the access token and is used to request a new access token in cases where it is expired.<br/>It can be considered as credentials used to obtain access tokens.It is allowed for long-lived access and highly confidential. Refresh tokens can be used for grant types â€“ authorization code and password credentials grant. Refresh tokens are intended for use only with authorization servers and are never sent to resource servers.<br/>
            Storing the access token in session storage and sending it via a Bearer access_token authorization header to my resource server. Then I can use httpOnly cookies for the refresh token.

            Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language that allows both technical and non-technically-minded users to query, manipulate, and change data in a relational database. Organized into columns and rows within a table. SQL databases are scalable vertically, meaning that you can increase the maximum load by adding further storage components like RAM or SSD.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that store data in a manner other than the tabular relations used within SQL databases. While SQL databases are best used for structured data, NoSQL databases are suitable for structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. NoSQL databases are scalable horizontally, meaning that they use multiple nodes in a cluster to handle increased workloads.

            In MongoDB, aggregation can be defined as the operation that is used for processing various types of data in the collection, which returns a calculated result.

            <p className="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            MongoDBs aggregate function will cluster out the records in the form of a collection which can be then employed for providing operations like total number(sum), mean, minimum and maximum, etc. from the aggregated group of data extracted.
